# Comparison-of-face-detection-algorithms-available-in-.Net
A real time application that compares four libraries to face detection avaible in C#. 

## Face detection libraries that was compared. 

- [FaceRecognitionDotNet](https://github.com/takuya-takeuchi/FaceRecognitionDotNet).
- [UltraFaceDotNet](https://github.com/takuya-takeuchi/UltraFaceDotNet).
- [HarrCascade](https://github.com/shimat/opencvsharp).
- [Dnn](https://github.com/emgucv).

The app is based on MVVM pattern. 
The app uses the Autofac cointainer to Dependency Injection. 

User can change application propeties in appsettings.json file. 
For example user can change camera device id or algorithm resolution.
